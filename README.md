# Optimizing Traffic Flow through Light Cycles

Using java, I will make a model of an urban traffic intersection. I will use this model to simulate traffic flow and a series a different light cycles. I will determine which light cycle is the most optimal based on which one results in the highest average vehicle velocity across the entire model.
